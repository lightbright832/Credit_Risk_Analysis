## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning tools such as Scikit-learn to perform predictive analysis. Financial institutions who extend consumer credit use these types of models to analyze the risk a consumer poses if credit were to be extended to them. The results of the analysis will determine the expected credit risk associated with the datasets provided.

## Results:

* Balanced Accuracy Score

The above image showcases the balanced accuracy score of the prediction models. A score of 77% (rounded) is not ideal but it is a good indicator that the prediction model will be effective in predicting risk.

* Classification Report

The classification report shows what the results would be when using datasets that are not balanced. This does have an impact on the ability of the tool to predict risk.

* Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix shows that there is a significant amount of false negatives but not many false positives.

* Classification Features

The above image represents the data features that were used to determine the credit risk of the subjects included in the datasets.

## Summary:
Based on the results of the analysis it is clear that machine learning tools are a great way to predict the financial risk a consumer poses to the financial institution. It does not appear that imbalanced datasets are the best way to capture credit risk. Datasets that are used in this manner should be balanced.
